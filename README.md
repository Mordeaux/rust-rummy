# Rust Rummy

It's gonna be a web app for playing the game Rummy online, with
friends or enemies, I don't care.

## Why would you make this?

Because I took a long break from coding to "find myself" or whatever,
and when it came time to look for jobs I realized I needed to get
back into the game. So I decided to make something pointless.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a cool language and I want to learn it. I can see why 
people love it so much that it is named the favorite language of
developers year after year. Also these days with the advent of 
WebAssembly, it can be run on the frontend and on the backend.

## Ok, sure, but would it make more sense, in an application like this, to use Javascript alone

Yes, from an engineering perspective it would have made a lot
more sense to write the game logic in JS and use the same logic
on the the frontend and backend that way, **but I didn't want
to do that**. *I wanted to use Rust*.
